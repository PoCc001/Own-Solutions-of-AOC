# Own-Solutions-of-AOC
Here I post my own solutions of the Advent of Code events starting from 2021. <p>
Put the Java files into a folder (package) called aocjava for them to work. <p>
I'm not 100% sure on which Linux distros the assembly version works. As of November 2023, I use NASM (version 2.14.02) as assembler and GCC (version 7.5.0) as linker. The Linux distro is openSUSE LEAP 15.4 on an x86 64-bit processor in a virtual machine. Maybe I'll use some AVX2 and FMA3 instructions in the future too.
